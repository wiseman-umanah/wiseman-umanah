{% block description %}
A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers on a network. In the context of websites, a server stores and delivers web pages, images, and other content to visitors. It acts as a central hub for communication and data sharing within a network.

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored electronically. It is designed to store, retrieve, and manage information efficiently. Databases are used to store a wide variety of data, such as customer information, product details, financial records, and more. In the context of websites, databases are often used to store information about users, products, orders, and other website-related data.
